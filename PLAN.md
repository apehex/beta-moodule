# Plan

> Code a single button app to set for the most rewarding climbing practice!

Climbers tend to focus on sending, which is misleading. You can send a route with poor technic and bet everything on the muscles. Always do routes well-below your level to avoid failure. It makes for a narrow experience and a very demanding training to improve your climbing level on a limited set of skills. 

Beta-climbing helps you explore and enjoy the full breadth of climbing.
Gamify your climbing and enhance your experience!
