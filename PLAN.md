## Organization

### Priorities

Basic Ui => track => dataviz => automation => chatbot ? 

### TODO

#### Ui

Main screen similar to Toggl :
- session or routes log in the middle
- start end session button
- preferences & history buttons

#### Tracking

Track & group climbing acttivity by :
- grades
- session:
  - indoor training
  - musculation & work out
  - stretching 
- style:
  - boulder
  - vertical
  - overhanging
- moment:
  - warmup
  - resting
  - climbing
  - stretching
- objectives:
  - perf
  - specific exercises
  - project
  - outdoor

Manual log:
- mood
- grade
- style
- objective
(at the end of the session)

Automated log:
- on/off the wall

#### Dataviz (progression)

Interpret climbing time:
- rest vs active
- overall climbing time
- resting & belaying time
- periods over the year
- NOT climbing time
- time using the application ~ motivation
- number of times performed a specific exercise
- ratio out / in
- repeat count on a project
- grades over time :
  - warm up time = low grade / max grade
  - peak time
  - confort time = conti

#### Objectives & skills

axes : cf max climbing p21
- willpower
- motor & technique learning
- physical training
- self awareness
- control (state)
- goal setting / overcoming adversity
- concentration / fear management
- mind programming
- behavior modification
- execution
- organisation (efficiency in preparing for a trip / session)

in the end everything is on the level of push on your left leg, transfer on your heel, straighten your arms... everything can be decomposed into simple, obvious moves & technique! just do it obviously

adjust expectations with current state: mood, fatigue

#### Debriefing & (Self-)Evaluation

Ask:
- mood
- perf
- fatigue:
  - noticed an easier move/hold where you could stay ?
  - missed a resting spot ?
- surprised : +/-
- overcome a difficulty ?

Spot (auto):
- difficulties
- time consuming tasks

#### Meta-training

Loop between the different session types
=> recommend one goal / one exercise per session
=> or options, but only one goal at a time

Push the user to take resting periods!
