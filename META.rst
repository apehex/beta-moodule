Metrics on the collected data to orient the training / grading.

First objective : interpret time !
- climbing time
- resting & belaying time
- NOT climbing time
- time using the application ~ motivation
- number of times performed a specific exercise
- ratio out / in
- repeat count on a project
- cotation over time :
  - warm up time = low grade / max grade
  - peak time
  - confort time = conti

Technic
-------

- climbing speed differs greatly IN / OUT

Mental
------

- goal seldom met

Physical
--------

Training
--------

- too long sessions
- out of proportion rest time at the end of the session
- growing rest time over session
- no rolling between session types

Planning
--------

- rest periods too short / intensity & climbing time

Carrying out
-----------

- plot the cotation of the routes over time
- compare to other profiles => intensity / time waste / speed
